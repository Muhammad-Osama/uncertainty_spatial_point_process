# uncertainty_spatial_point_process
Given events across space \x (e.g. crime locations across a city), the code above can be used to obtain intensity interval across space (in e.g. crimes per unit area) which have valid coverage even under model misspecification. One can also obtain a point estimate of the intensity function across space. Moreover, one can also predict the number of counts in a given spatial region and get an interval in units of counts 

The code above is related to our work: M. Osama, Dave Zachariah, Peter Stoica, "Prediction of Spatial Point Processes: Regularized Method with Out-of-Sample Guarantees", NeurIPS 2019.
